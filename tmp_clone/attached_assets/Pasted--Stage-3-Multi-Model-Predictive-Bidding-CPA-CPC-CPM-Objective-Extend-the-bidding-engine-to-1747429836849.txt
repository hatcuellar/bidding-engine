🟧 Stage 3: Multi-Model Predictive Bidding (CPA, CPC, CPM)
🎯 Objective
Extend the bidding engine to support CPA (fixed and %), CPC, and CPM models. Move away from a “highest bid wins” system and instead evaluate all bids—regardless of model—using predictive data science to determine which bid delivers the most value for both brand and partner.

✅ 1. Supported Incentive Models
Model
Description
Requirements
CPA – Fixed
e.g., £10 per conversion
Must be flat, universal rate
CPA – %
e.g., 10% of order value
No metadata-based commission logic
CPC
e.g., £0.50 per click
Prone to click fraud, requires hygiene checks
CPM
e.g., £5 per 1,000 impressions
Simple, can still use highest-bid logic

⚠️ Brands must define min and max thresholds for each model type.

✅ 2. Predictive Value Modeling
For each brand-slot bid, the engine must calculate an estimated value per impression or per click, using predictive signals.
For CPA:
Estimated CVR × Payout = Value per impression
For CPC:
Estimated CTR × Payout = Value per impression
For CPM:
Bid ÷ 1000 = Value per impression

✅ 3. Key Input Signals (Modeling Layer)
Historical slot performance (CVR, CTR, AOV) by brand and partner


Similar brand performance in similar slots


Partner quality signals (Placement Verification Score, content suitability)


Device type, creative type, category alignment


Real-time pacing, spend, and competition context



✅ 4. Bid Scoring & Decision Logic
All bids across all models are normalized to an estimated value-per-impression score


The engine ranks bids and selects the one with the highest predicted value


Supports mixed-model competition (e.g., a CPA bid might beat a CPM bid if predicted conversion likelihood is high)



✅ 5. Brand Optimization Settings (Optional)
Brands may define bid strategy preferences, such as:
“Maximize ROI”


“Maximize Reach”


“Minimize CPA/CPC”


“Even budget pacing over time”


“Target specific slots or partners”


These can influence how the engine weighs predictions and ranks bids.

✅ 6. Safeguards & Rules
CPA model constraints:


Must remain simple: no product metadata-based variation


CPA/CPC + CPM coexistence:


Brand can configure whether conversions from CPM/CPC traffic should trigger CPA payouts


Default: CPA disabled on CPM/CPC-originated traffic unless explicitly enabled
